# pycord-slash-command-bot
Pycord Slash Commands example template. This is a public bot for anything that wants it. It will work with Py Cord's Slash command system and will be configured for anyone to use. I will be adding to this over time but it's for anyone that wants it or maybe needs help with a command.
